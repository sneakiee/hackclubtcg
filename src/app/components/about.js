                    HackClubTCG is my implementation of the trading card game
                    from Apocalypse into a website! currently due to skill issue,
                    the game is going to be still in development and this will mainly
                    be a pack opening simulator for a little bit of excitement and
                    dopamine for collecting cards!

                    hello! i've been holding off on this project for
                    wayyyyy too long due to school and overestimating
                    my abilities to create things. i needed a project for 
                    high seas so i was going to create this but then high seas 
                    kinda was over when i was ready to start over again. but here
                    it is for cafe and due to my limited time once again, it 
                    will be less of what i wanted it to be, but eventually
                    will HOPEFULLY become what it was gonna be originally! :p
